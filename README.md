## Overview

Small retailers often face challenges such as inaccurate demand forecasting, overstocking, inefficient warehouse operations, stockouts, and ineffective supplier negotiations. SKY addresses these challenges by automating key processes through a distributed multi-agent system. Our solution harnesses advanced machine learning models, integrates diverse data sources, and provides real-time insights via an intuitive dashboard and mobile application. The platform is engineered for scalability—adapting to local market conditions and enabling seamless integration with existing systems.

## Features

- *Real-Time Demand Forecasting:*  
  Leverages historical sales and market data to predict future demand using time-series models (e.g., LSTM, Prophet).

- *Dynamic Inventory Management:*  
  Monitors inventory levels, detects discrepancies, and automates restock alerts with predictive analytics to minimize dead stock and reduce holding costs.

- *AI-Driven Pricing:*  
  Optimizes pricing dynamically based on real-time supply, demand, and competitor data to maximize revenue and margins.

- *Warehouse Operations Agent:*  
  Manages intra-warehouse logistics including shelf optimization, bin-packing, FIFO/LIFO stacking, and pick-path optimization for seamless inventory access and flow.

- *Supplier Integration & AI Negotiation:*  
  Enables multi-supplier connectivity and automates procurement decisions. The AI Negotiator agent uses contextual understanding and historical pricing patterns to negotiate better deals autonomously.

- *Customer Engagement:*  
  Delivers personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and customer segmentation via AI-powered insights to boost customer retention.

- *Multi-Agent Framework:*  
  Implements a distributed architecture where individual agents (Forecasting, Inventory, Pricing, Warehouse, Supplier, Negotiator, and Customer Engagement) communicate in real time through a central coordinator.

- *User-Friendly Dashboard & Mobile Application:*  
  Provides an intuitive interface for monitoring KPIs, visualizing actionable insights, and interacting with various system modules.

## Architecture

The SKY solution is built on a modular and scalable architecture:

- *Data Integration:*  
  Ingests data from multiple sources (e.g., POS systems, warehouse sensors, supplier feeds, market analytics).

- *Module-Specific AI Models:*  
  - Demand Forecasting Module: Predicts sales trends.  
  - Inventory Management Module: Automates tracking and restock alerts.  
  - Dynamic Pricing Module: Adjusts pricing in real time.  
  - Warehouse Management Module: Optimizes internal logistics and item placement.  
  - Supplier Integration Module: Facilitates multi-channel procurement.  
  - AI Negotiator Agent: Interprets supplier terms and executes negotiation strategies to maximize profitability.  
  - Customer Engagement Module: Personalizes marketing based on customer behavior.

- *Distributed Multi-Agent System:*  
  Each module operates as an autonomous agent, coordinating via a central meta-agent that aggregates insights and directs actions.

- *Edge-to-Cloud Hybrid Workflows:*  
  Leverages local edge processing to reduce latency and cloud resources for intensive analytics and storage, ensuring continuity even in low-connectivity environments.

- *API-First Ecosystem Integration:*  
  All components interact through standardized APIs enabling seamless data exchange and future expansion.

## Datasets & Data Processing

The project uses four core datasets:
- demand_forecasting.csv: Historical sales, seasonality, and trend data.
- inventory_monitoring.csv: Logs inventory levels, discrepancies, and audits.
- pricing_optimization.csv: Historical pricing, competitor pricing, and sales impact.
- warehouse_layout.csv: Contains SKU placement, bin codes, pick-paths, and zone maps for logistics optimization.

*Data Processing Steps:*
1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*  
   Identify trends, anomalies, and key features.
2. *Data Cleaning & Transformation:*  
   Standardize, aggregate, and prepare features for model training.
3. *Feature Engineering:*  
   Extract relevant metrics such as moving averages, turnover rates, zone density, and path optimization parameters.

---

## Usage

- *Dashboard:*  
  Access KPIs such as forecast accuracy, stock turnover, pricing efficiency, supplier costs, warehouse throughput, and negotiation results.

- *Mobile App:*  
  Receive restock alerts, warehouse tasks, and supplier negotiation updates in real time.

- *Inter-Agent Communication:*
